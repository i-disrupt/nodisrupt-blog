Introducing my newest blog app, built with Next.js and powered by TypeScript. This app offers a somewhat-sleek and intuitive interface for reading and keeping up with new blog posts, all while taking advantage of the performance benefits of a Next.js framework. With the added support for Markdown, writing and formatting posts been significantly easier.

## Starting the app:
Download this repository with: **git clone**
``` 
git clone https://github.com/i-disrupt/nodisrupt-blog.git ./blog && cd ./blog
```

Start the app:
```
npm run dev
```

This app is deployed on port `:3000`, view the app by going into Chrome and putting `http://localhost:3000/` into your broswer.

## Post formatting:
This app uses `Markdown` to format blog posts and supports basic markdown features. I recommend you use a [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://www.w3schools.io/file/markdown-cheatsheet/) if you're not already famillar with Markdown.
Posts are automatically added to the app on refresh once you've created a new post in the `./posts` folder.
